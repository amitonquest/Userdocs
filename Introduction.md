# ðŸ‘‹  Welcome to Qyrus Device Farm!

Qyrus Device Farm provides real mobile devices on cloud for manual and automated testing of web apps, native mobile apps and hybrid apps.


Device Farm allows the users to run their own automated tests(Appium) or run manual tests by taking control of the device using their mouse and keyboard. As the sessions are completed, a detailed report that contains device vitals, logs, screenshots and performance data gets generated.
